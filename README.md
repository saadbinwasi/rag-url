# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) on Google Colab

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline in Google Colab using Hugging Face libraries. The pipeline involves fetching unstructured data from multiple website URLs, breaking it into chunks, embedding the chunks into vectors, and then storing these embeddings in a vector database. Finally, a large language model (LLM) is used to answer questions based on the retrieved data.

### Key Components
- **Unstructured URL Loader**: Uses Hugging Faceâ€™s `UnstructuredURLLoader` to collect unstructured data from websites.
- **Data Chunking**: The data is split into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
- **Embedding**: The text chunks are embedded into high-dimensional vectors using a Hugging Face model.
- **Vector Database**: The embeddings are stored in a vector table for fast similarity search.
- **LLM**: A pre-trained language model is used to generate answers by retrieving the most relevant chunks.

## Features
- Collects data from websites via URLs.
- Breaks down the data into manageable chunks.
- Embeds the text into a vector representation for efficient search.
- Uses an LLM to answer questions based on the retrieved chunks.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Google Colab (Recommended for ease of use and free GPU access)
- Hugging Face Account (for loading models)

### Install Required Libraries

In your Colab notebook, run the following to install the required libraries:

```bash
